  title: Introduction to Pandas
  description: This workshop is an introduction to the popular data science library
    Pandas. The workshop will be using a Jupyter notebook to work through a case study
    and find answers to questions. The workshop will be using Python3. If you don't
    have python installed, the recommended way is to use Anaconda as it has everything
    pre-installed. It is expected that the attendees would already have some experience
    working with Python and is looking to expand their knowledge in the area of data
    analysis. The source code used for the workshop would be available on Github.

    \ Sussman on the new MIT introduction to programming course, which (in Sussman's\
    \ view) focused more on building practical applications at the expense of many\
    \ computer science fundamentals.\n\nThe talk will look at some of the advantages\
    \ and pitfalls of the increasing trend of using Python as an introductory programming\
    \ language: partially through some personal anecdotes and partially through friends\
    \ and colleagues' experiences. It will also look at the increasing divergence\
    \ between those involved in software development and those who, educated through\
    \ Python, are based in other domains as their primary job but are using their\

    \ Scheme (aspects of fundamental programming and comparing a 'traditional' computer\

  title: Can we talk? Machine Translation with Keras.
  description: In this talk I will describe and present ideas for a machine translation
    prototype implemented in Keras. I will cover Neural Machine Translation, which
    is an approach to machine translation that uses a large neural network. It departs
    from phrase-based statistical approaches that use separately engineered subcomponents.
    E.g. Google uses Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) in preference to its
    previous statistical methods. NMT has highly promising performance for large training
    data. The common principle is encoding the meaning of input into concept space
    and performing translation based on encoding which leads to deeper understanding
    and learning of translation rules, for better translation than SMT. The problem
    is the tendency towards overfitting to frequent observations and overlooking special
    cases. With the cause that the translational function is shared, so high- and
    low-frequency pairs impact each other by adapting shared parameters. Smoothness
    of translation function makes infrequent pairs seem like noise.

    \ service is favorable, but how to make sure consistency between development and\
    \ deployment? With Docker and Terraform, we can create the same environment on\
    \ cloud easily. For example, we will deploy a Jupyter notebook on Google Cloud\
    \ Platform using both tools.\n\nTalk Description\n============\nIn this talk,\
    \ we will use a task: hiring a GPU on Google Cloud Platform to train neural network,\
    \ as an example to show how an application can be deployed on a cloud platform\
    \ with Docker and Terraform. The goal is to have Jupyter Notebook running in an\
    \ environment with Tensorflow (GPU version) and other libraries installed on a\
    \ Google Compute Engine.\n\nFirst we will briefly explain what is Docker and what\
    \ is Terraform for audiences who has no experience in either or both of them.\
    \ Some basic concepts of both tools will also be covered. After that, we will\
    \ walk-through each steps of the work flow, which includes designing and building\
    \ a Docker image, setting up a pipeline on Github and Docker Hub, writing the\
    \ Terrafrom code and the start up script, launching an instance. From that, audiences\
    \ will have an idea of how both tools can be use together to deploy an app onto\
    \ a cloud platform and what advantages each tool can bring in the process.\n\n\
    This talk is for people with no experience in application deployment on cloud\
    \ service but would benefit form computational reproducibility and cloud service,\
    \ potentially data scientists/ analysts or tech practitioners who didn\u2019t\
    \ have a software developing background. We will use an example that is simple\

    \nThe healthcare sector produces vast quantities of three dimensional images for\
    \ the diagnosis and treatment of a large variety of medical conditions. Traditionally,\
    \ the 3D images are reviewed by a highly qualified healthcare professional such\
    \ as a radiologist or surgeon. As a result, the diagnosis and treatment of patient\
    \ is time consuming, expensive and not scalable; moreover, this approach has limited\
    \ efficacy as the medical doctor may not be able to obtain a general understanding\
    \ of the anatomic three dimensional structure (e.g the shape and size of a tumor,\
    \ the position of each bony fragment in a complex fracture, the location of an\

  title: Django APIs, Versioning and You
  description: "This talk will attempt to explain how to version an API within the\
    \ Django framework. Say you need to change the data that your API returns to your\
    \ users, but any major changes would result in breaking the API for users of any\
    \ previous versions. This talk will explain how to avoid this problem, which as\
    \ a developer who works on APIs with the Django framework every day is a constant\
    \ problem that I would have to face. \n\nThis talk will cover:\n\n1.) Why do I\
    \ even have to version my API in the first place? Surely I can just make changes?\n\
    \n2.) Okay, now I understand why to version my API in Django. What about the how?\
    \ (this will mainly focus on the Django REST framework's library of versioning,\
    \ but other methods will be considered) \n\n3.) Live Demo of breaking changes\
    \ (oh no!) and how we can apply our knowledge from the second part of the talk\
    \ and avoid these."

  title: Write your own Bitcoin clone in Asyncio
  description: 'Richard Feynman wrote on a blackboard: "What I cannot create, I do
    not understand". We can build a solid understanding of the Bitcoin protocol by
    implementing a clone from its fundamental building blocks: asymmetric encryption,
    a peer-to-peer network (using the asyncio module), and proof of work. This "talkshop"
    explains how cryptocurrencies work in simple terms and with practical examples.
    Just some basic knowledge of Python required. We will also learn about cypherpunk
    culture, the value of money, and how decentralised systems work.'

  title: Visualisation in Python - Quick and easy routes to plotting magic
  description: "The ability to explore and grasp data structures through quick and\
    \ intuitive visualisation is a key skill of any data scientist. Different tools\
    \ in the Python ecosystem required varying levels of mental-gymnastics to manipulate\
    \ and visualise information during a data exploration session. The array of Python\
    \ libraries, each with their own idiosyncrasies, available can be daunting for\
    \ newcomers and data scientists-in-training. \n\nIn this talk, we will examine\
    \ the core data visualisation libraries compatible with the popular Pandas data\
    \ wrangling library. We'll look at the base-level Matplotlib library first, and\
    \ then show the benefits of the higher-level Pandas visualisation toolkit and\
    \ the popular Seaborne library. By the end of the talk, you'll be bar plotting,\
    \ scatter plotting, and line plotting (never pie charting) your way to data visualisation\
    \ bliss."

  title: Python on Windows is Okay, Actually
  description: "Packages that won't install, encodings that don't work, installers\
    \ that ask too many questions, and having to own a PC are all great reasons to\
    \ just ignore Windows. Or they would be, if they were true.\nDespite community\
    \ perception, more than half of Python usage still happens on Windows, including\
    \ web development, system administration, and data science, just like on Linux\
    \ and Mac. And for the most part, Python works the same regardless of what operating\
    \ system you happen to be using. Still, many library developers will unnecessarily\
    \ exclude half of their potential audience by not even attempting to be compatible.\n\
    This session will walk through the things to be aware of when creating cross-platform\
    \ libraries. From simple things like using pathlib rather than bytestrings, through\
    \ to all the ways you can get builds and tests running on Windows for free, by\
    \ the end of this session you will have a checklist of easy tasks for your project\
    \ that will really enable the whole Python world to benefit from your work."

  title: A Quick Offline Trip Through Kubernetes
  description: "This workshop is aimed at Python programmers who aspire to learn about\
    \ Kubernetes and take advantage of the efficiency and flexibility it offers. We\
    \ will use a simple Flask application that allows users to create, edit and save\
    \ Jupyter notebooks \u201Cin the cloud\u201D - you can think of it as a poor man\u2019\
    s JupyterHub to teach the participants about Kubernetes. After this workshop,\
    \ the participants will be able to:\n\n1) Describe containers and container orchestration\n\
    2) Describe the architecture and components of Kubernetes\n3) Run a Kubernetes\
    \ cluster on their notebook\n4) Deploy and manage services on the cluster\n5)\
    \ Write declarative recipes for reproducing the setup universally"

  title: "Domain-specific Languages in Python. The Why and\_How."
  description: "Domain-specific languages can be incredibly useful in boosting your\
    \ productivity within their area of focus (think RegExp, CSS or NumPy). And they\
    \ often allow you to improve communication about the problem area with non-technical\
    \ people.\n\nBut it's not a tool most Software Practitioners feel comfortable\
    \ employing. This talk is an attempt to fix that \U0001F642. \n\nWe'll look at\
    \ the situations when it can be beneficial to create a DSL. \n\nAnd explore various\
    \ approaches to building internal DSLs with Python.\n---\nYou can find all the\
    \ examples, references and slides here: https://github.com/Stvad/pyconie_dsl"
